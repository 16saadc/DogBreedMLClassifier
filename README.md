# DogMLClassifier

To start, clone this repository and add a dataset for dog breeds. A suggested dataset is from http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/

Run classifier.py, then run turi_train.py

This could take about 20 minutes depending on the size of the dataset used.

Now, your MLModel is ready to be used with CoreML in your iOS app!
